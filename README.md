# DPG State of the Community Report (SCoRe) 2024

The rise of population-scale technology is transforming public services and impacting billions, driven by Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) that can help nations achieve their goals and advance the Sustainable Development Goals. Digital Public Goods (DPGs), the open-source building blocks behind DPIs, play a crucial role in addressing global challenges. However, the long-term sustainability of DPGs relies on vibrant developer communities that enhance product quality, foster innovation, and drive adoption. Currently, DPG builder and adopter organizations are at varying stages in their journey towards community development, demonstrating different levels of success and maturity.

To support and better understand this journey, the DPG State of the Community Report seeks to provide a holistic overview of the current state of community-building efforts across DPGs, offering insights into both organization and developer perspectives.

Through this report, we aim to provide actionable guidance to help technologists, policymakers, and community organizers foster thriving ecosystems for DPGs worldwide.
